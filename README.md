The following are files from my interactive workshop project at Młodzieżowy Dom Kultury Zamość attended by the students from a local primary school. The main goal was to present pieces of information as animated flashcards using a virtual environment in a memory palace style. It proved to be an appealing way for young students to learn about a given subject. Later on, the children were presented with a short quiz and every correct answer was rewarded with an opportunity to modify the game scene using a given set of pre-selected assets. The uploaded scene is the result of a whole workshop session.
